# Deploy to Vercel

Deploy any project to Vercel. **Always deploy as preview** (not production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

The goal is to get the user into the best long-term setup: their project linked to Vercel with git-push deploys. Every method below tries to move the user closer to that state.

## Step 1: Gather Project State

Run all four checks before deciding which method to use:

# 1. Check for a git remote
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null

# 2. Check if locally linked to a Vercel project (either file means linked)
cat .vercel/project.json 2>/dev/null || cat .vercel/repo.json 2>/dev/null

vercel whoami 2>/dev/null

# 4. List available teams (if authenticated)
vercel teams list --format json 2>/dev/null
```

### Team selection

If the user belongs to multiple teams, present all available team slugs as a bulleted list and ask which one to deploy to. Once the user picks a team, proceed immediately to the next step — do not ask for additional confirmation.

vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>
```

If the project is already linked (`.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json` exists), the `orgId` in those files determines the team — no need to ask again. If there is only one team (or just a personal account), skip the prompt and use it directly.

**About the `.vercel/` directory:** A linked project has either:
- `.vercel/project.json` — created by `vercel link` (single project linking). Contains `projectId` and `orgId`.
- `.vercel/repo.json` — created by `vercel link --repo` (repo-based linking). Contains `orgId`, `remoteName`, and a `projects` array mapping directories to Vercel project IDs.

Either file means the project is linked. Check for both.

**Do NOT** use `vercel project inspect`, `vercel ls`, or `vercel link` to detect state in an unlinked directory — without a `.vercel/` config, they will interactively prompt (or with `--yes`, silently link as a side-effect). Only `vercel whoami` is safe to run anywhere.

## Step 2: Choose a Deploy Method

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + has git remote → Git Push

This is the ideal state. The project is linked and has git integration.

1. **Ask the user before pushing.** Never push without explicit approval:
   ```
   This project is connected to Vercel via git. I can commit and push to
   trigger a deployment. Want me to proceed?
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   git add .
   git commit -m "deploy: <description of changes>"
   git push
   ```
   Vercel automatically builds from the push. Non-production branches get preview deployments; the production branch (usually `main`) gets a production deployment.

   sleep 5
   vercel ls --format json
   ```
   The JSON output has a `deployments` array. Find the latest entry — its `url` field is the preview URL.

---

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + no git remote → `vercel deploy`

The project is linked but there's no git repo. Deploy directly with the CLI.

vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
```

vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

For production deploys (only if user explicitly asks):
vercel deploy [path] --prod -y --no-wait
```

---

1. **Ask the user which team to deploy to.** Present the team slugs from Step 1 as a bulleted list. If there's only one team (or just a personal account), skip this step.

2. **Once a team is selected, proceed directly to linking.** Tell the user what will happen but do not ask for separate confirmation:
   ```
   Linking this project to <team name> on Vercel. This will create a Vercel
   project to deploy to and enable automatic deployments on future git pushes.
   ```

3. **If a git remote exists**, use repo-based linking with the selected team scope:
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>
   ```
   This reads the git remote URL and matches it to existing Vercel projects that deploy from that repo. It creates `.vercel/repo.json`. This is much more reliable than `vercel link` (without `--repo`), which tries to match by directory name and often fails when the local folder and Vercel project are named differently.

   **If there is no git remote**, fall back to standard linking:
   vercel link --scope <team-slug>
   ```
   This prompts the user to select or create a project. It creates `.vercel/project.json`.

4. **Then deploy using the best available method:**
   - If a git remote exists → commit and push (see git push method above)
   - If no git remote → `vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status

---

   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   vercel login
   ```
   The user completes auth in their browser. If running in a non-interactive environment where login is not possible, skip to the **no-auth fallback** below.

3. **Ask which team to deploy to** — present team slugs from `vercel teams list --format json` as a bulleted list. If only one team / personal account, skip. Once selected, proceed immediately.

4. **Link the project** with the selected team scope (use `--repo` if a git remote exists, plain `vercel link` otherwise):
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>   # if git remote exists
   vercel link --scope <team-slug>          # if no git remote
   ```

5. **Deploy** using the best available method (git push if remote exists, otherwise `vercel deploy -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>`, then `vercel inspect <url>` to check status).

### No-Auth Fallback — claude.ai sandbox

```

**Arguments:**
- `path` - Directory to deploy, or a `.tgz` file (defaults to current directory)

**Examples:**
# Deploy current directory

# Deploy specific project

# Deploy existing tarball
```

The script auto-detects the framework from `package.json`, packages the project (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`), uploads it, and waits for the build to complete.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [previewUrl]. Claim it at [claimUrl] to manage your deployment."

---

### No-Auth Fallback — Codex sandbox

   command -v vercel
   ```

2. **If `vercel` is installed**, try deploying with the CLI:
   vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
   ```

   skill_dir="<path-to-skill>"

   # Deploy current directory

   # Deploy specific project

   # Deploy existing tarball
   ```

The script handles framework detection, packaging, and deployment. It waits for the build to complete and returns JSON with `previewUrl` and `claimUrl`.

**Tell the user:** "Your deployment is ready at [previewUrl]. Claim it at [claimUrl] to manage your deployment."

**Escalated network access:** Only escalate the actual deploy command if sandboxing blocks the network call (`sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). Do **not** escalate the `command -v vercel` check.

---

## Agent-Specific Notes

For the no-auth fallback, run the deploy script from the skill's installed location:
```
The path may vary depending on where the user installed the skill.

### Sandboxed environments (claude.ai)

You likely cannot run `vercel login` or `git push`. Go directly to the **no-auth fallback — claude.ai sandbox**.

### Codex

---

## Output

Always show the user the deployment URL.

- **No-auth fallback:** Show both the preview URL and the claim URL:
  ```
  Deployment successful!

  Preview URL: https://my-app-abc123.vercel.app
  Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...

  View your site at the Preview URL.
  To transfer this deployment to your Vercel account, visit the Claim URL.
  ```

**Do not** curl or fetch the deployed URL to verify it works. Just return the link.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Network Egress Error (claude.ai)

If deployment fails due to network restrictions on claude.ai, tell the user:

```
Deployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:

1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities
2. Add *.vercel.com to the allowed domains
3. Try deploying again
```

### Escalated Network Access (Codex / sandboxed environments)

Example guidance to the user:
```
The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Vercel. I can rerun
the command with escalated permissions — want me to proceed?
```

If `vercel login` or `vercel deploy` fails with authentication errors, fall back to the no-auth deploy script (claude.ai or Codex variant, depending on the environment).
